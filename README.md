### Hi there 👋, I'm Matthew
Hi, I'm **Matthew**, *a.k.a* **MT** or **Mingde**.

- 🤖 I am passionate about *free/libre and open source software* and I'm 100% into **community-driven** development. Some of my popular projects:
  - (author) [M-EMACS](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d), a full-featured Emacs configuration "distribution".
  - (maintainer) [Emacs Application Framework](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework), a framework that extends the graphical capabilities of Emacs.
- 🔭 I'm currently an undergraduate student studying **Mathematics** at [@uWaterloo](https://github.com/uWaterloo).
- 📎 I previously had internships at [@Wind-River](https://github.com/Wind-River) *(Linux & [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/))* and IFDS *(Full Stack)*.
- 💡 Fun fact: I'm also a [Photographer](https://www.instagram.com/mt.photographyx/) 📸 and a WSET Wine Sommelier🍷.

Skills: Python / C++ / C / Emacs Lisp / Java / JS / more
